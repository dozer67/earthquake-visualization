<h1><center> Documentation Page Regarding 2023 Earthquake Visualization </center></h1>

<h2> The Design Process </h2>
<p> In the beginning, I envisioned an idea of an interactive world map where anyone could visualize the earthquakes around the world for 2023. Each time you hovered over a dot that signified an earthquake, all the information from the dataset like Date & Time, Latitude, Longitude, Depth, Magnitude, Lands & Country would be available in a textbox off to the side. I began the journey on Observable where a template was available that would allow me to accomplish what I set out to do. However, I quickly found out that I could not use this template for my project. After looking deeper into the code in search of inspiration, I realized that the code involved concepts not present within the <i>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</i>, so I decided to avoid it all altogether due to not having enough time to understand more advanced concepts. After some discussion and guidance from my professor, I settled on a scatterplot with depth (in km) on the y-axis and magnitude (energy released) on the x-axis. The original idea is available here: https://observablehq.com/d/f61194c910285eba. </p>

<h2> Design Choice Rationale </h2>
<p> As delineated above, I had an idea that I really wanted to pursue but then had to pivot due to difficulty and available time. While not as visually pleasing as a world map, the scatterplot still gets the job done and performs exactly as I wanted the world map to. Visualizing the information was best done through a scatterplot, since the individual depth and magnitudes varied and would not be easily contained with other methods like bar charts or graphs. The visualization itself is rather simple in design, and that is how I wanted it. I believe with visualizations, it is important to showcase the information in a manner that would be easily accessible to the average person looking at it. This means heavily contrasted colors like orange and a dark gray are a great way to visualize individual earthquakes. As for the tick marks, they are the perfect size to not interfere with the axis labels and be legible to read. I also chose to display a small textbox that would pop up for each point, showcasing the other information along with the exact values for depth and magnitude. All in all, the scatterplot choice proved to be the most effective option to display the information within the earthquake dataset. This is because most people have seen or interacted with a scatterplot and are already familiar with its format; many people are also familiar with basic x and y coordinate. Furthermore, the spread of individual earthquakes are now easily distinguished based on two of the most important factors when it comes to an earthquake: depth and magnitude.</p>

<h2> How was the Visualization Used to Answer My Question? </h2>
<p> The overarching question I wanted to answer was this: What are the most common depths and magnitudes of earthquakes for 2023? With this question in mind while creating a scatterplot, I knew I would be able to identify where most of the points were clustered together. And sure enough, I found what I was looking for. Whether navigating back to the visualization itself or by looking at the screenshot below, it is evident that most of the earthquakes occurred between the magnitudes of 2-5 and at a depth of 0 to 300 kilometers. Remembering from my geology class in my freshman year, this makes sense because most of the earthquakes do occur in the shallow-intermediate depths. The values of magnitude present in the dataset are on the low end. The most common magnitude for an earthquake is 5.0 and above. Along with the visual plots for magnitude and longitude, I also wanted the data directly from the dataset in a textbox format, which can be easily seen by hovering over any orange dot within the visualization. <img src="C:\Users\sterg\Desktop\d3\screenshot_visualization.png" alt="Screenshot Description" width="1200" height="300"> </p>
